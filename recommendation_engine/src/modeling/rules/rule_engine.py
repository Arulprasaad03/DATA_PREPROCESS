MODULE: src\modeling\rules\rule_engine.py

PURPOSE
-------
Evaluate configured candidate rules and return an audit trail.

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS
---------------------------
- Return passed/failed, rule ID, reason and affected candidate for every decision.
- Support rule priority and enable/disable configuration.
- Do not mix rule decisions into affinity scores.

ARCHITECTURAL CONSTRAINTS
------------------------
- Raw data must remain immutable.
- Validation and cleaning must remain separate responsibilities.
- Invalid records must be traceable through quarantine.
- Configuration should contain business-specific rules.
- Processing should be deterministic and idempotent.
- Every important transformation must be auditable.
- Do not silently discard records.
- Do not invent business rules.
- Do not perform feature engineering in preprocessing modules.
- Do not train recommendation models in preprocessing modules.

EXPECTED AI CODING AGENT BEHAVIOR
--------------------------------
- Inspect the repository before implementing.
- Inspect actual input data before assuming column names or types.
- Read configuration before hard-coding thresholds.
- Reuse existing utilities instead of duplicating logic.
- Add tests for important behavior.
- Preserve the directory architecture.
